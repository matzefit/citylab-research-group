Matthias Fitzky is a PhD Candidate in Urban Systems at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering located in Downtown Brooklyn, NY

Prior to attending this program he's been working as a Research Assistant at the [Advanced Material and Building Efficiency Laboratory](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/centers-labs-and-projects/amber-lab.html), Department of Civil Engineering at New York University Abu Dhabi.

He received a B. Eng. degree in Surveying and Geoinformatics in 2018 and a M.Sc. degree in Photogrammetry and Geoinformatics in 2019 from the [University of Applied Sciences Stuttgart](https://www.hft-stuttgart.de). Throughout hisstudies he specialized in the subject of 3D [Geographical Information Systems ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) with a focus on 3D City Models and their applications in thermal energy simulations. HisM.Sc. thesis research focused on the development of a concept for cooling energy demand simulations of buildings under the use of 3D City Models of Singapore. During that time, he's been working at the [Singapore Land Authority](https://www.sla.gov.sg/) where his research project has been conducted in collaboration with the Geomatics Department of the SLA. Before joining AMBER Lab, He's been working as a Research Assistant at the Centre for Geodesy and Geoinformatics under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Volker Coors](https://coors-online.de/) from the HFT Stuttgart. He's been involved in several projects dealing with the prediction of heating energy demand of buildings and implementing building’s energy labelling methods. His current research is focusing on assessing the radiative heat transfers in urban environments in New York City.
